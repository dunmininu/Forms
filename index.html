                    The light came without the spark 
                    It is sad how death comes faster than life. 
                    As the thunder hits after the much dreaded beautiful lights.
                    The storm rages on. 
                    The wars with red dots, 
                    Peace, a now vague concept. 
                    Man, an enemy to the mirror. 
                    Hatred, a newfound love. 
                    To arms! The war cry bleats. 
                    Animals seek a steep end 
                    The world at end.

                         It's funny how a dancing body would one day become stiff and lifeless.
                        God and his sense of humour. 
                        Very sarcastic
                        Even in death, we can find a piece of light.
                        And that lies in the moments shared with the soul that once inhabited the now cold flesh.
                        Death and time are twins
                        Only a few would know this.

                        Gasping for air from melting our essence for a long time 
                        With warmth and thrusts
                        Grasping for a something to hold with exasperated breaths from building heat in the moment    
                        Oh might I continue, I'd go up in flames
                    </li>
